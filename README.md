# Description #
A combinator(chest) that can read blueprint and output as signals all items, that are necessary to build that blueprint. Also works for blueprint books, in that case all nested blueprints are counted. Supports quality from Factorio 2.0, with a toggle in the mod settings to enable or disable the distinction.
